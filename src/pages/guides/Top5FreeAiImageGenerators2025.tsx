              <p>The world of AI image generation is exploding with incredible tools, and many of the best are available to use for free. While there are dozens of models, these five stand out for their quality, unique features, and robust free tiers. Hereâ€™s a quick review of five top-tier models that you can use with PromptCraft today.</p>

              <h3>1. Midjourney</h3>
              <p><strong><Link to="/tools/image?model=midjourney" className="text-primary hover:underline">Midjourney</Link></strong> is renowned for its artistic and stylized outputs. It's the go-to choice for creating beautiful, painterly, and often surreal images that look like they belong in a gallery.</p>

              <h3>2. DALL-E 3</h3>
              <p><strong><Link to="/tools/image?model=dall-e-3" className="text-primary hover:underline">DALL-E 3</Link></strong> excels at understanding natural language and creating coherent, story-driven scenes. It's particularly good at following complex instructions and is integrated directly into tools like ChatGPT.</p>

              <h3>3. Stable Diffusion</h3>
              <p><strong><Link to="/tools/image?model=stable-diffusion" className="text-primary hover:underline">Stable Diffusion</Link></strong> offers incredible flexibility and control for those willing to learn its parameters. As an open-source model, it has a massive community building custom models and tools on top of it.</p>

              <h3>4. Ideogram</h3>
              <p><strong><Link to="/tools/image?model=ideogram" className="text-primary hover:underline">Ideogram</Link></strong> is particularly strong at accurately rendering text within images, a task that many other models struggle with. If you need to create a logo or a poster with words, Ideogram is a fantastic choice.</p>

              <h3>5. Leonardo AI</h3>
              <p><strong><Link to="/tools/image?model=leonardo-ai" className="text-primary hover:underline">Leonardo AI</Link></strong> provides a full suite of tools for game developers and artists, including custom model training, texture generation, and more, making it a complete creative workflow solution.</p>
